Helm charts for [s3gw][s3gw]

s3gw is an S3-compatible service focused on deployments in a Kubernetes
environment backed by any PVC, including [Longhorn][longhorn].
Since its inception, the primary focus has been on cloud native deployments.
However, the s3gw can be deployed in a myriad of scenarios, provided some form
of storage is attached.

s3gw is based on Ceph’s RADOSGW (RGW) but runs as a stand–alone service without
the RADOS cluster and relies on a storage backend still under heavy development
by the storage team at SUSE. A web-based UI for management and an object
explorer are also part of s3gw.
